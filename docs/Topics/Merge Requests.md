## My Process

This is how I like to do my process, but yours can be different or set by your project lead.

- Create a "Draft" Merge Request at the start of my work
- Do the work
- When done, remove "Draft" status and request [[Code Reviews]]
- If more work is required (bug found or responding to review comments), mark as a Draft again to pause reviews
- Once approved, merge (following [[Workflow]] process)

> [!tip] Drafts
> I use "Draft" in my Merge Requests to indicate the work is not ready to be reviewed.
> If using "Draft" this way, make sure the team is on board, so they all know when to review code.

> [!tip] Merge Checklist
> GitLab default [issue templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html) can be set up, allowing for checklists of all the steps for a Merge Request to encourage the process.
 
> [!question] Pull Request vs Merge Request?
> Generally, they likely refer to the same thing. There are some [subtle differences](https://www.hatica.io/blog/pull-request-vs-merge-request/) though.

## Scenario

- I like writing code my way, but it's different from the rest of my team

## Key Takeaways

- Guidelines are project dependent - ask your leads
	- If you are a lead, come up with a starting set of guidelines (they can always be updated later)
- Refine guidelines through the [[Feedback]] process
- Enforces consistency between developers and within individual code
- If the style is enforce programmatically, making changes is easy
- Propose guidelines if none exist
	- It's a lot easier to get buy-in on a draft than asking for one to be created
- Don't get too bogged down by guidelines. They are nice to have, but shouldn't halt progress
- Use tools to automatically format code
	- VSCode - "Format code" in toolbar

## Coding Guidelines

- Naming conventions for variables and functions
	- Make names easy to understand
	- Avoid ambiguous abbreviations
- Magic values
	- Unclear why they were chosen, units
- Keep use case in mind
	- Consider context when developing and commenting
	- If on a sensitive project, don't use sensitive terminology or terms in comments on an otherwise non-sensitive project - saves review and cleanup time later
- Formatting
	- Tabs vs spaces (this is important in some languages, like Python)

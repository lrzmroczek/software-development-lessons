## Scenario

- Someone suggested a tool that will "make my life easier" - but it's hard to use
- I know enough about a tool to get my job done, but it's a struggle
- I don't know what tool to use to do my work
## Key Takeaways

- The right tools make the job **MUCH** easier.
- Read the documentation or do the tutorials for tools you will use - it will save time in the long run

> [!tip] Learning tools is part of your job
>  It's ok to spend time working through tutorials and learning how to use the tools effectively. It will make you more efficient and productive overall!

## Code Tools

### Static Code Analyzers

> [!question] Why use it?
> Helps maintain consistent code quality and best practices.

There are many tools available to analyze, standardize, and clean up code in automated ways. 

Some examples are:

- Type checking
- Linting - Static analysis on source code to flag patterns that might cause errors or other problems ([reference](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/tool_lint/))
- Code formatter
- [[Logging]]

### Templates and Blueprints

> [!question] Why use it?
> Using templates helps standardize code and implements pre-configured best practices

Some example code blueprints from @hagenjt1:

- https://github.com/johnthagen/clang-blueprint
- https://github.com/johnthagen/python-blueprint

### Debuggers

> [!question] Why use it?
> Makes debugging code MUCH easier! See the [[Debugging]] section for more info.

- gdb


## Workflow Tools

### Source Control

> [!question] Why use it?
> Tracks changes as you work and lets you always go back to a working state...provided the changes were committed! **So commit often!!**

- Git

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

> [!question] Why use it?
> CI/CD can automate testing and verifying that code is correct by building and running tests. This can help prevent [[Breaking Changes]].

Some example tools:

- GitLab CI
	- There is a lot of contents and it can be daunting to learn...but is not that hard!
	- GitLab's documentation is pretty good: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/
- Bamboo CI
	- Ties to BitBucket

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

> [!question] Why use it?
> IDEs can streamline the development process and have a lot of features to make life easier

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- PyCharm
- CLion

### Notetaking

> [!question] Why use it?
> Keeping good [[Documentation]] will help yourself and others on the team

Some example tools:

> [!tip] Confluence labels
> I found adding [labels](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/use-labels-to-organize-your-content/) to Confluence pages makes finding them much easier. This allows you to group similar pages by content or topics so you can find all related pages at once.
